New command line option $(B -mscrtlib=$(I libname)) for Windows MS-COFF object files.

If building MS-COFF object files with -m64 or -m32mscoff, this option
specifies the reference to the C runtime library $(I libname) that is 
embedded into the object file containing `main`,
`DllMain` or `WinMain` for automatic linking. The default is $(TT libcmt)
(release version with static linkage), the other usual alternatives are
$(TT libcmtd), $(TT msvcrt) and $(TT msvcrtd).
If $(I libname) is empty, no C runtime library is automatically linked in.
